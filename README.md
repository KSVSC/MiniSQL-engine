# MiniSQL-engine

This is an implementation of Mini SQL engine in python which will run SQL queries using command line. 

This mini SQL engine performs query processing like `SELECT`, `PROJECT`, `DISTINCT`,`AGGREGATE`, `JOIN` with relational operators (`<`,`>`,`>=`,`<=`,`==`) and bool operators (`AND`,`OR`).

### Usage:
`python3 minisql.py <"SQL Query;">`

Make sure you maintain case consistency while giving the input-queries. Example, Use SELECT or select but not Select.

### Acknoledgement
This was implemented as part of the Database Systems course at IIIT-Hyderabad.
